        <p>
          Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[24]
          Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born
          mother.[25][26] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the
          University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid
          mandatory service in the South African military.[27] Musk arrived in
          Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan
          for a year,[28] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[29] In
          1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[30][31]
          Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he
          graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a
          Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.

        <h3>Other activities</h3>
        <p>
          In 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain, assigning a
          dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX to establish the conceptual
          foundations and create initial designs.[169] On August 12, 2013, Musk
          unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[170] The alpha
          design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the
          Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[171] The document scoped out the technology
          and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be
          built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay
          Area at an estimated total cost of $6 billion.[172] The proposal, if
          technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make
          Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such
          long distances.
