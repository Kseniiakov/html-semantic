            Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[24]
            Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born
            mother.[25][26] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the
            University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid
            mandatory service in the South African military.[27] Musk arrived in
            Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan
            for a year,[28] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[29] In
            1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[30][31]
            Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania;
            he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics
            and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.

            Bezos attended the Student Science Training Program at the
            University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National
            Merit Scholar,[37][38] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[37]
            In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the
            day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his
            intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a
            huge national park".[39] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from
            Princeton University with a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in
            Engineering degree (B.S.E.) in electrical engineering and computer
            science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[40][41] While at
            Princeton, Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of
            Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[42] In addition, he was elected to Tau
            Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the
            Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).
